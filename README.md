# AmazonCode

### Instructions
I used maven to build the project in eclipse. To run it, install maven, go to the directory where you unzipped, and run “mvn test” to run all of my unit tests. You can also run it from eclipse if you have eclipse installed. The main program takes user input for the char value and the num of indices.
